Make sure our code follows these best practices, UNLESS there's a comment explaining why it's okay to break the rule.

1. Avoid typos.
2. Don't have like, really obvious bugs.
3. Don't store secrets in code.
4. Use a logging library, not console.log, print, etc.
5. Follow reasonable conventions of the language we're programming in. No need to be too strict.
6. Avoid dangerous stuff, like things that could lead to template injection, SQL injection, broken access control, or really anything that would show up as a CVE somewhere.
